# Overview

## Background:
Engagement in aerobic exercise is the current standard of care treatment for concussion; patients who exercise at higher volumes post-injury have symptoms resolve quicker. However, unknown are the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms which are altered during post-concussion exercise that subsequently contribute to symptom resolution.  

**Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)** is a neuroimaging approach that measures concentrations of various neurometabolites (chemicals) in the brain. For example, Myo-Inositol is often used as a marker of glial cell activity, increasing in concentrations when oxidative stress is present or neurons are damaged. Choline is essential for cell membrane support and is a precursor for neurotransmitter synthesis. Glutamate-Glutamine are excitatory neurotransmitters involved in executive functioning tasks and also serves as an important energy source for neurons when recovering from injury. And Glutathione is an anti-oxidant that responds to oxidative stress in damaged cells. In measuring these neurometabolites, researchers can gain insight into the chemical changes occurring post-injury and can more objectively quantify physiological responses to rehabilitation.  

The relationships between these neurometabolites and post-concussion exercise behaviors may better inform the underlying mechanisms by which exercise contributes to concussion recovery.  

## Objective:
Our **primary objective** was to compare neurometabolite concentrations of Myo-Inositol, Choline, Glutamate-Glutamine, and Glutathione at two timepoints in concussion recovery: initially within 21-days of injury when patients are still symptomatic, and again within 5-days of physician clearance to return-to-sport (i.e., no longer symptomatic).  

Our **secondary objective** was to investigate how exercise behaviors at various points in recovery are associated with these four neurometabolites.
